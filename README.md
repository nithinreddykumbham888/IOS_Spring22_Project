# Indian_Premier_League_2022
This project deals with Indian Premier League 2022 where we created an IOS Project to show the current playing teams and a brief information of each team including team players and their statistics. We also included details of previous ipl winners and the players with most runs and wickets for that team. We used structs to populate the data.
